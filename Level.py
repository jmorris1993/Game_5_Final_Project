# The description of the world and the screen which displays
# the world
#
# A level contains the background stuff that you can't really
# interact with. The tiles are decorative, and do not come
# with a corresponding object in the world. (Though you can
# change that if you want.)
#
# Right now, a level is described using the following encoding
#
# 0 empty   (light green rectangle)
# 1 grass   (green rectangle)
# 2 tree    (sienna rectangle)
#
# you'll probably want to make nicer sprites at some point.


#
# This implements a random level right now. 
# You'll probably want to replace this with something that 
# implements a specific map -- perhaps of Olin?
